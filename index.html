          <h2>About Me:</h2>
          <p>
          In the 1980's and 1990's I primarily wrote computer programs in the C, Turbo Pascal, and Cobol languages. For twenty years I left the work force to raise my children. Now that my children are grown I have been teaching myself to design
          and implement my own website using both front-end and back-end programming skills. In my spare time I like to exercise, travel, and spend as much time with my family as I can. Click on the links below to see the code I wrote to make this website happen!
