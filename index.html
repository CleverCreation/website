          <h2 class="about">About Me:</h2>
          <p class="bio">
            In the 1980’s and 1990’s I wrote programs in Machine Code, DOS, BASIC, C, Turbo Pascal, and COBOL. For the next twenty years I left the work force to raise my children and the technology moved on without me. Now that my children are in college, I decided to restart my love of coding. As of January 19th, 2021, I had only heard of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and had never coded or styled a webpage before. In less than three months I have taught myself how to code in HTML and CSS and have taken basic lessons in JavaScript, MySQL, SVG, Bootstrap, and C#. The HTML and CSS used for this work-in-progress website was created using Visual Studio Code and published on github.com. <br><br>
